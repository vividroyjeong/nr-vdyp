#
# Dynamic Logging Library template configuration file.
#
# Example, and basic, VDYP7 logging file.
#
# This logging configuration file creates a single appender that logs
# every logged message that is presented to it into a file found
# in the current directory.
#
# For details on how to modify or otherwise extend this sample, refer
# to the 'DynLogConfigTemplate.txt' for a complete rundown of the
# technical capabilities available to you.
#
# This file is loaded through the VDYP.INI file in the [Logging] section
# under the 'LoggingConfigurationFile' item.
#
# You can modify the INI file to point to a new configuration file
# or else you can supply the following command line parameter after the
# INI file has been loaded:
# 
#    -dbgCfg <logConfigFileName>
#
#
# The INI file also disables logging by default.  You can override
# this behaviour by modifying the INI file directly or supplying the
# following command line parameter after the INI file has been loaded:
#
#    -dbg <Yes|No>
#
# You can also modify the logging configuration file as well to disable
# logging by setting the 'context.Enabled' property to 'No' or 'False'.
#


#===============================================================
#
# Environment/Substitution variable definitions.
#
# Define environment/substitution variables for use throughout
# the Dynamic Logging library and outside into the application
# itself.
#
# All Environment/Substitution variables have the form:
#
#    env.varName = value
#
# This would define a substition variable named 'varName' and
# any occurrence of it would be substituted for its
# substitution value: 'value'.
#
# Any environment variable/substitution variables are scanned
# in this file prior to loading Appenders, Loggers, Context or
# other information and therefore may be scattered throughout
# this file.
#
# Process environment variables are inherited and available for
# reference in this file in the same way as if you had defined
# them locally.
#
# An environment/substitution variable is referred to by 
# wrapping the variable name as such:  $(varNm)
#
# Substitution variable names are not case sensistive and so
# $(varNm) and $(VARNM) and $(varnm) all refer to the same
# variable.
#
# Substitution variabled may contain a reference to another
# substitution variable.  Therefore, for the following 
# definitions:
#
#    env.varBase = def
#    env.varContain = abc$(varBase)ghi
#    env.overAll    = 12$(varContain)34
#
#    The variable $(overAll) would expand out to: 12abcdefghi
#
# A Substitution variable may have multiple references to
# other substitution variables:
#
#    env.Multi = -$(varContain)-$(varBase)-
#
#    would expand out to: -abcdefghi-def-
#
# IMPORTANT:  Recursive definitions will cause the application
#             to die without grace.  Ensure you do not create a
#             variable definition that does refers to itself
#             either directly or indirectly through an embedded
#             variable's definition.
#
#             env.Var1 = very$(Var2)
#             env.Var2 = something-$(Var1)-bad
#

# env.sample = sampleEnvVal


#===============================================================
#
# Context Wide Configuration Points
#
# The following properties are essentially 'global variables'
# within the logging context and apply to all parts of the
# logging library.
#
# The only context wide configuration item you would be likely
# to change would be the 'Enabled' flag but each is described
# fully.
#
#     Enabled
#        A master switch to turn all logging on or off.
#        This switch applies and overrides any other 
#        'Enabled' setting.  You may enable or disable the
#        global context as often as you want.
#
#        If disabled and then switched to enabled within
#        the application, all individual 'Enabled' settings
#        are then considered.
#
#        Setting this value to 'No' does not affect the
#        value of the corresponding setting of any other
#        property setting.
#
#     MaxLineLength
#        Sets the default maximum line length for internal buffers
#        when formatting and generating lines. This value sets the
#        of allocated buffers, and where feasible, truncates lines
#        to that number of characters.
#
#        The value used here may be overriden bu individual loggers
#        by providing a logger specific 'MaxLineLength'
#        configuration value.
#
#        If this value is not specified, a default value of 512 is used.
#
#        NOTE: There is an important consideration to keep in mind that
#              using a large value for the maximum log line length has
#              tradeoff in allocated memory and unused process memory
#              will increase as this value gets larger.
#
#        IMPORTANT: While efforts are made to keep formatted messages
#                   within the bounds of the message buffer, it may
#                   not be possible to predict that when data is in
#                   its final formatted form, will fit within the
#                   bounds of the buffer.
#
#     EstimatedNumAppenderTypes
#        This controls the estimated total number of appender
#        types that will ever be defined in the configuration
#        file.  Typically you should never need to change this
#        value.  The default is provided.  Making smaller to
#        match the true value will have a negligible effect
#        on application performance.  You would want to increase
#        this value if a number of new Appender Types were to be
#        declared.
#
#        In any run involving Dynamic Logging, there will always
#        be at least two built-in Appender Types defined: the
#        'Default' appender type and the 'Null' appender type.
#
#        Some power of 2 are good choices for this value.
#
#     EstimatedNumAppenders
#        This controls the estimated total number of appenders
#        that will ever be defined in the configuration file.
#        Typically you should never need to change this value.
#        The default is provided.  Making it smaller to match
#        the true value will have a negligible effect on application
#        performance.  You would want to increase this value if
#        a large number of Appenders were to be declared.
#
#        Some power of 2 are good choices for this value.
#
#     EstimatedNumLoggers
#        This controls the estimated number of loggers that will
#        ever be defined through the application lifetime.
#        Loggers are created as code is executed and so the total
#        number of potential loggers might be hard to estimate
#        depending on total code coverage through execution.
#
#        Like the other estimates, it is OK to underestimate the
#        total number if that is how execution works.
#
#        Finding a true value for this estimate requires a fair
#        bit of inside knowledge of the application to know how many
#        routines have been instrumented for logging and how likely
#        any of those loggers are going to be required.
#
#        Some power of 2 are good choices for this value.
#
#

context.Enabled                        = Yes
context.MaxLineLength                  = 512

#===============================================================
#
# Appender Types
#
# Define a new appender type that can be dynamically hooked
# into the Dynamic Logging System at run time so long as
# sufficient hooks are provided.
#
# A new appender type is created with by referring to it with
# any declaration.
#
# Once defined, the appender type is used in an appender
# definition using the 'AppenderType' declaration.
#
# Appender Type Names are case insensitive.
#
# 'Default' appender type is created when the logging library
# is launched.  If you do not supply an appender type for a
# particular appender, it is assumed to be of the 'Default' 
# appender type.
#
# 'Null' appender type is also created when the logging library
# is launched and operates as a No-Operation appender.  It works
# similarly as if an appender were disabled.  The difference here
# is that enabled or not, the appenders of the Null type immediately
# return without logging anything (data goes into a black hole).
#
# The Null appender type is used when a user supplied Appender 
# Type is not correctly specified or some part of the initialization
# of an instance fails for some reason.
#
# You can not change the hooks associated with the 'Default' or 
# 'Null' appender types.
#
# You are free to create appenders of the Default and Null types.
#
# This section does not create appenders, it defines the basic
# capabilities of an appender.  These capabilities are identified
# by naming hooks from a DLL or shared library that can be loaded
# at runtime.
#
# Appenders have the following operations that must be supplied
# for new appender types.  These operations are provided by references
# to a routine within a DLL the user identifies in this configuration
# file.
#
# The function prototypes for these functions can be found in the
# "dynlog.h" header file.
#
# How these routines go about performing the individual tasks are
# immaterial:
#
#    InitializeLibrary
#       Initializes any background resources and/or checks for
#       basic requirements before any instances of a particular
#       Appender Type are created.
#
#       This hook may be at least once and perhaps numerous times, but
#       the first call must result in a prepared library for the
#       Appender Type and any subsequent calls must not interfere
#       with that initialization (i.e. the first call is the
#       important one and subsequent calls are unimportant).
#
#    CreateInstance
#       This hook, when called, will create and return a handle
#       to a new instance of the appender type ready to be used
#       to log messages in a manner defined by the appender type.
#
#    SetProperty
#       Provides a property name and a value that the hook routine can
#       use to change characteristics of an appender instance.
#
#       A property may be set or reset at any time, before or after
#       an appender instance has started logging messages.
#
#       Some properties for an appender instance will define a destination
#       for logged messages.
#
#       There are certain properties that are common across all appender
#       types and these properties should not be handled by this 'SetProperty'
#       hook.  Those properties are:
#                Enabled
#                MinMsgPriority
#                MaxMsgPriority
#
#       The above properties are intercepted and handled by the Dynamic 
#       Logging library.
#
#       All other properties are supplied through this hook with their
#       associated value and it is the responsibility of this hook to deal
#       with them with respect to the appender instance.
#
#    StartOutput
#       This hook will prepare the output stream to accept new messages
#       and send them on.  This hook is called once per instance.  If
#       messages are requested to be sent prior to the output being
#       'started', they should either be quietly ignored or cause an implied
#       'StartOutput' call to occur.
#
#       Any instructions on how to start the output for a particular instance
#       are expected to have been provided through properties for that 
#       instance.
#
#    LogMessage
#       The appender is presented with formatted text to be sent through
#       the appender's output stream.
#
#    StopOutput
#       This hooks stops further output by closing the output stream.
#       If any attempts to log messages occurs once the the output is closed,
#       these attempts should be quietly ignored.
#
#    DestroyInstance
#       This hook will destroy a specific instance of an appender
#       type.
#
#    ShutdownLibrary
#       Releases all remaining resources held by the library including
#       any remaining appenders that may still be in existance.
#
#
# The specification of routines providing the hook the activity type is
# provided by a DLL name, a vertical bar, and the name of the routine
# within the DLL providing the functionality.
#
# The hooks may be scattered across DLLs.
#
# The DLL must be on the process PATH, or it must be fully qualified.
# The DLL path name can be built with environment variables such as
#     $(EXEDir)\YOUR.DLL|RoutineHook
#
#


#
# Create a new Appender Type named 'newApndrType' and identify all
# all the hooks for that appender.
#
# Once specified this way, new instances of that appender type can be 
# used as any other appender and is transparent to the dynamic logging
# framework.

# appenderType.InitializeLibrary.newApndrType  = YOUR.DLL|InitializeLibraryHook
# appenderType.CreateInstance.newApndrType     = YOUR.DLL|CreateInstanceHook
